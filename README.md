# water-safety-visualization
This is a little project for me to learn new programming skills :)

Currently figuring out:
- Flask
    - requests
- Connecting frontend and backend
- Error handling for user inputs

Future TODOs:
- (possibly) Transition to Java backend for efficiency
- Nicer frontend
- Concentration of each contaminant
- Pop up information on each contaminant
- Options for outside the US
- Interactive map?

Completed: 
- using pandas
    - dealing with large databases
    - accessing and searching for data
